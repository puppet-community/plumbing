Vox Pupuli Governance
====================


Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------

In order to have a smoothly running project, formal roles with corresponding responsibilities are established. A member of the community may have multiple roles.


Users
-----

*How to become one*: Use a Vox Pupuli project


Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community: without them, the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no specific requirements. Users should be encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Common user activities include (but are not limited to):

* Advocating for use of the project
* Informing developers of project strengths and weaknesses from a user’s perspective
* Providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)
* Writing documentation and tutorials
* Filing bug reports and feature requests
* Participating on the discussion board


Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved. Such users may then go on to become collaborators and contributors, as described below.



Contributors
-------------

*How to become one*: Submit a pull request to a Vox Pupuli project

Contributors are community members who submit patches or other contributions(art, docs, user support, etc) to the project. These patches may be a one-time occurrence or occur over time. It is anticipated that contributions may be small at first, growing more considerable once the contributor has built up the necessary knowledge, experience, and confidence.



Collaborators
------------

*How to become one*: Be a contributor and be nominated to the PMC as a collaborator. Nominations should be sent to <email address for nominations>. You may nominate yourself. It is also common to give collaborator status to an individual who donates code to the project by migrating a repository to the github namespace.

Collaborators are contributors who have shown wide dedication to the Vox Pupuli project in general or deep dedication to one project in particular, and the ability to work well with contributors and other users. The collaborators have responsibilities beyond the contributors. In particular, collaborators formally decide on whether a pull request is merged or a release is cut. Collaborators are recognized and valued for their contributions, in whatever form those contributions take. Tasks such as communication, documentation, art, packaging, and testing are all valued contributions. A collaborator will use lazy consensus to decide on whether to merge a pull request from a contributor. If the discussion is no longer moving towards a consensus, the PMC must vote via lazy consensus on whether the patch should be applied.



Project Management Committee (PMC)
----------------------------------

*How to become one*: Win in the yearly election.


The project management committee has responsibilities beyond collaborators that include participating in strategic planning, release planning and approving changes to the governance model. One of the most important duties is to uphold the community code of [conduct](https://voxpupuli.org/coc/) and ensure its values. The PMC has to make decisions when community consensus cannot be reached.

The PMC has final say over who can become a committer and will use lazy consensus for approval. Discussion over committer nominations will be done in private.

Membership of the PMC is by election. [Condorcet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) voting is held once a year. A non-running election official is appointed by the PMC and runs the election. There are 5 members of the PMC. Terms are 1 year.

The PMC doesn't have specific roles or a chairperson.



Specialized Roles
-----------------


There are three officer roles in VoxPupuli. They can all be held by the same person (though this isn't ideal), as long as the work is getting done. They can have any other role in the organization, including being on the PMC. The PMC is responsible for requesting volunteers and appointing a volunteer to the role. Appointments last until either the officer steps down, or the unlikely and unfortunate situation where the PMC removes the officer. The PMC can add more officer roles as it sees fit by modifying this document.

1) Election Officer: The election officer can be on the PMC, as long as they are not running in the election they are officiating

2) Security Officer: This is the point of contact for external or internal security issues, this person has a published gpg key, and will be the main point of contact for CVE numbers and such

3) Communications Officer: This is the main point of contact for external and internal publicity and marketing efforts and requests


Lazy Consensus
--------------

Lazy consensus is a very important concept within the project. It is this process that allows a large group of people to efficiently reach consensus, as someone with no objections to a proposal need not spend time stating their position, and others need not spend time reading such statements.

For lazy consensus to be effective, it is necessary to allow at least 72 hours before assuming that there are no objections to the proposal. This requirement ensures that everyone is given enough time to read, digest and respond to the proposal. This time period is chosen so as to be as inclusive as possible of all participants, regardless of their location and time commitments.

We do require one affirmative vote as part of the Lazy consensus model.

Vox Pupuli has a public mailing list. This list is low-traffic and is for discussion of anything Vox Pupuli related. Controversial patches, nominations for promotion, policy shifts, and anything else can be brought to this list. All contributors and PMC members are expected to be on this list. Release announcements will go out to this list, but will have ``[Release]`` in the subject line so they can be easily filtered.

When the lazy consensus model does not converge on a decision or outcome, the PMC can step in and choose a path.



PMC Removal
-----------

A member of the PMC can be removed before the end of their 1 year term by a supermajority (2/3) vote of the PMC. This can happen for a number of reasons, but the expected reason is following a Code of Conduct violation incident. Any report of problematic behaviour of PMC members will trigger an investigation and can trigger a vote. A report of the incident and actions taken (if any) will be published for the public. A member of the PMC can step down at any time.

If a vacancy is left on the PMC, the PMC can optionally instruct the elections officer to perform another election, wait until the next election cycle, or use the results of the previous election to select a new member, if the previous election is recent enough.



Transparency
------------

Building community trust in the governance of an open-source project is vital to its success. To that end, decision making must be done in a transparent, open fashion. No decisions about the project’s direction, bug fixes or features may be done without community involvement and participation. Discussions must begin at the earliest possible point on a topic; the community’s participation is vital during the entire decision-making process.



Election
--------

The details of the election process are up to the elections officer, subject to approval by the PMC. The users, collaborators, and contributors all get to vote in the election.
