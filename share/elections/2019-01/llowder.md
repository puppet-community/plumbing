# Lee Lowder

Hi!

My name is Lee Lowder, also known as friedbob. I am a Vox Pupuli contributor since 2015. Puppet is my preferred automation toolkit since 2012. Currently I help out in IRC and Slack when I can, and mash green merge buttons every chance I get. You can find me almost 24/7 in our IRC channel and from time to time on conferences.

A few of my Puppet related projects:
- Syntax highling for editing puppet modules in nano - [puppet-nano][pn]
- A (no longer useful with the advent of lookup --explain) hiera debugger - [Zwiebelschaler][zs]
- A load testing / performance tool for puppet 6 (WIP) - [pupperware-party][wp]
- Numerous reported issues and PRs to puppet, puppet documentation, and related modules

I invest a fair amount of time into Vox Pupuli and would love to continue and expand on this with official tasks. I want to put my focus on the following two tasks if elected:
- Improving documentation and ensuring consistent documentation for all modules
- Security Champion/Evangelist
